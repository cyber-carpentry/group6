# Group6
This is a clone of the repo that hosts the code of a hydrology-related research paper published by Sadler et al. 2018 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.044.
This repo serves as a use case of setting up and running a research reproducibility workflow. 

The following changes & additions were made:
* Re-run and slightly modified python, Jupyter Notebook, and R codes locally (local machines) to define dependencies, check packages, and fix broken links to data (minor changes can be tracked by checking our commits).
* Addition of docker containers for 3 processes (2 parallel for data analytics and a subsequent serial one for modeling)
* Snakefiles used to automate the workflow process.
* Binder for interactively testing scripts.

The team members that led this effort were participants of the Cyber Carpentry 2019 workshop at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
